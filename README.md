# LoLAbilityGuessingGame
A python program that randomly shows the names of abilites of all LeagueOfLegends-Champions to let you or your friends guess.
It has a GUI (tkinter) and a built-in Timer (default: 20s) which lets you or your friends guess the champion name an ability slot (Passive, Q, W, E or R).
It takes a JSON-file as input where I stored all the champion names and their corresponding abilites.
The JSON file is not created by this program, but by another python script which I run manually once every time a new champion is released or something else changes.
